Hey there! I'm Pranav, a computer science student at UCLA.

I get my kicks by writing convoluted code, watching SciFi movies and listening to trippy music.

Through this page, I aim to disperse the following:
- Career information (LinkedIn sucks)
- Mediocre code chatter
- Music you probably won't like
- Philosophy, Metaphysics and other blog BS

About me:
- I'm a Konkani from Bangalore India (that would make me a South Indian).
- Contrary to popular opinion, I'm a positive happy go lucky person.

You can contact me by sending an email to [pranavtbhat@gmail.com](mailto:pranavtbhat@gmail.com).
